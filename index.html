          <h2>How To Dog</h2>
          <p>First, you gotta sniff everything, especially those trees!
            When you feel the urge to run, just go for it; paws up, tail wagging!
            When you see a ball, you fetch it, even if it's far.
            And don't forget to wag your tail when you're happy.
            Also, naps are very important, so find a comfy spot and rest up.
            When it’s time to go out, always ask for a treat afterward, and give lots of cuddles, it's a good way to show you care!</p>

          <h2>What Is Dogs</h2>
          <p>Dogs are creatures who love to run, play, and explore. 
            We sniff, bark, and wag our tails to show we're happy. 
            Dogs stick together, protect each other, and love our humans more than anything. 
            We sleep a lot, but when we're awake, we're ready for adventures, treats, and lots of love. 
            Being a dog means being loyal, joyful, and always ready for a good belly rub!</p>

            <h2>Facts From Dog</h2>
            <p>Dogs have super strong noses that can smell things far away—way better than humans! 
              We can hear higher-pitched sounds, like a dog whistle, that you can't. 
              Some dogs like to dig, but it's usually because we're looking for something cool or comfy to lie in. 
              We come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny Chihuahuas to big Great Danes. 
              And when we wag our tails, it usually means we're happy or excited to see you!</p>
